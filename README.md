## Metronome
This project is my attempt to build a modern, lightweight and consistent metronome for Android,
using the Kotlin programming language, and modern Android SDK features.

At phase 1, this is a working metronome with only the most basic features and a basic material
design UI, but it will be the skeleton of a more advanced implementation.
